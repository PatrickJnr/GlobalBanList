When committing changes, please include a rationale for adding to the list, along with any relevant screenshots or supplementary information to substantiate the addition of the ID.

Most moderation discord bots allow the use of mass banning. Carlbot for example will be /moderation massban [members] USERID, USERID, USERID, and so on. If you do not have a automod in your discord then I do suggest using carlbot or anyone that has this feature.
